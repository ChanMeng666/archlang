# Preview-and-remodel cards

Rules (same as `../plan-soundness/cards.md`): pick the first `todo` card whose dependencies are done
and whose wave is open (`README.md` §4). Status words: `todo`, `doing`, `done` (cut to id, title,
status, PR, commit; the as-built note goes verbatim to a dated `research/` record in this folder),
`parked`. Sizes are AI-assisted days (the archlang-3d plan's track B), ±50 %. "Model" is the
suggested executor; the main session may override. Every card lists what it must **not** do.

## 0. Gates every card runs

| When | Commands |
|---|---|
| Always (floor) | `npm run check` then `npm run check:drift` |
| Anything outside `src/` (including `test/`, `packages/`, `playground/`) | `npm run build` then `npm run typecheck:all` (a new workspace is added to its list) |
| Any `docs/*.md` edit | `npm run docs:build`; tables escape `\|` inside inline code; fragments use `arch static` fences |
| Playground | `npm run build && npm run playground:build:only && npm run e2e:playground` |
| 3D package heavy tests | `npm run check:3d` (created by A1) |
| Every PR | branch from `main` in a worktree, `feat/<card>-<slug>`; PR body per the template; reviewer posts `reviewed <full sha>` then `gh pr merge <n> --auto --merge --match-head-commit <40-char sha>`; a later push voids the pin; CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` conflicts keep both entries; at most two red-team rounds |

## A · The checked 3D preview (archlang-3d M0–M1 recut; D1, D2)

Baseline facts for every A-card: `../archlang-3d/development-plan.md` §3 (architecture), §4
(algorithms), §6.1/§6.5 (viewer, time seam), §7 (CLI), §8 (checks), §9.8/§9.10 (day list, week-one
kit); `amendment-v0.7.md` (the recut). The viewer subset of three.js 0.186.1 is 140 kB gzip (MIT).

### A0 · Core exports C1/C2 and ADR 0031 — `done` · PR #319 · merge `6e510aff` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A0

### A1 · M0: package skeleton, adapter, H1, Scene3D v0 — `done` · PR #325 · merge `88d83823` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A1

### A0b · Close the seam's two naming gaps — `done` · PR #338 · merge `9f3e51c5` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A0b

### A2 · M1a geometry: Mesh3D from Scene3D — `done` · PR #328 · merge `da464b51` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A2

### A2b · Mesh finish before the look round — `todo` · residue of A2 · 1.5 days · model: opus

**Goal.** What A2 left: the 12 T0 parametric furniture families laneway-house uses (grey boxes
today, §4.4); V-GEO-05 `W3D_FLOOR_OVERLAP` (rooms overlapping by more than 1 cm², with the plan's
0.5 mm deterministic lift; the core already warns `W_ROOM_OVERLAP`); window glass on a curved host
as a chord that runs into the body near its jambs; the T-junctions where a wall body meets its sill
or lintel (each shell closed; a viewer may show hairlines); the slab as rooms ∪ wall outline less
voids (today the wall footprint less voids, so a room outside every wall has no slab); a demolished
wall (B3a) drawn from `ir.drawn`. **Acceptance.** Each with a corpus or synthetic test; Mesh3D stays
deterministic and laneway's pinned digest moves only with a recorded reason. **Depends on.** A2.

### A3 · M1a replay viewer and CLI video — `done` · PR #330 · merge `323a3ee2` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A3

### A4 · M1b GLB, checks and the `check:3d` CI job — `done` · PR #336 · merge `75072487` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A4

### A5 · M1c playground 2D/3D toggle (opens Tier A) — `done` · PR #340 · merge `0d1cbda7` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § A5

### A6 · M1d in-browser WebCodecs MP4 — `parked` (D12) · 1 day · model: sonnet

Unpark when a Tier A post needs it. Labelled non-deterministic; muxer through the Q20 gate; never a CI gate.

### A7 · `--doors plan` for the replay — `todo` · residue of A3 (accepted, D14) · 1 day · model: opus

**Goal.** `archlang3d view --doors plan`: each door leaf drawn at its plan opening (swung) instead of
closed (Q11). Needs each leaf's open tip in Scene3D (`openings[].leaves`, from the core's
`doorLeaves`). **Acceptance.** Corpus test: every leaf's open pose inside its swing sector; the default
replay (closed doors) byte-identical; key-frame pins unchanged. **Must not.** Change the default.

### A8 · Wave-3 residue — `todo` · residue of A3–A5, A0b · 1 day · model: opus

Each item small; one PR or several. (1) A5's ±1 % startup-chunk gate fires on ordinary core growth
(a re-bless hazard): gate on the 3D chunk staying lazy and three.js absent from startup, with a wider
size tolerance, and say why in the spec. (2) A5: three compiles per edit with the 3D tab open; the
360 px tab strip; with no storey picked the switcher underlines L1 while the tab shows all storeys.
(3) A4: the GLB leak regex (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` only, can false-positive on a plan name);
`readGlbNodes` walks two levels; the pack test excludes all of `src/`. (4) A0b: `MIN_CORE` and the
package's peer range move to 1.45.0 at its first publish. (5) A3 (owner's next look): the 30° end
elevation of one-storey views hides most furniture (`endElevation`, `camera.ts`). (6) B3b: a derived
`open between` on a demolished wall still draws as a cased opening inside the dashes; `against wall
<id>` places on a demolished wall; the `new` legend row waits for a hatch option.

## B · The renovation wedge (language; D6–D9)

### B1 · Lock check without syntax — `done` · PR #323 · merge `68065481` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § B1

### B2 · `keep locked` syntax — `parked` (D6)

Opens when a consumer needs the lock inside the source. Design sketch: `keep locked <id> [, <id>…]`,
checked by `impact --against` through the same path as B1.

### B3a · Wall `status` semantics — `done` · PR #329 · merge `f4b62e92` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § B3a

### B3b · Wall `status` drawing, DXF, legend, example — `done` · PR #337 · merge `28116116` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § B3b

### B4 · Quantities: `describe --facts quantities` and `arch takeoff` — `done` · PR #324 · merge `8031dd86` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § B4

### B5 · Imperial input literals — `done` · PR #327 · merge `ba6f66e8` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § B5

### B6 · `W_GARAGE_OPENING_UNDERSIZED` — `done` · PR #320 · merge `9280f256` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § B6

## C · Drafting order in guidance (D3, D4)

### C1 · The canonical sequence, written down — `done` · PR #321 · merge `faef9228` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § C1

### C2 · Skill and plugin wording — `done` · PR #322 · merge `324f87c5` · record: `research/2026-10-28-as-built.md` § C2

---

## D · Professional output

### D1 · DXF `BLOCK`/`INSERT` and `DIMENSION` (backlog U.13) — `todo` · wave 4 · 3 days · model: opus

Doors, windows and catalogued furniture as block definitions with one `INSERT` each; dimensions as
`DIMENSION` entities; AIA layer names kept; a DXF round-trip test through an independent reader
(`ezdxf` in a Python `-I` check script under `e2e/`, not a runtime dependency). Byte-identity of SVG
untouched; DXF digests re-pinned on purpose with the reason in the PR.

### D2 · IFC4 — archlang-3d M5, unchanged (Q4, Q17). Not a card here.

## E · ArchCanvas (specified in that repository)

`archcanvas/docs/specs/2026-10-28-value-theatre-and-canvas-tweaks.md`: E1 quick-action telemetry;
E2 visible self-check (`check` field on the progress event, plain-language copy); E3 door flip and
furniture nudge quick actions; E4 the 3D preview tab (Tier B only). Listed here so a session sees the
whole programme; the cards are owned there.

## F · Growth (specified in the growth repository)

F1 claim corrections (filed 2026-10-28); F2 Tier A posting kit (after A3; four to six posts, each with
a playground permalink; measurement rows added to `data/`); F3 the N10 read.
