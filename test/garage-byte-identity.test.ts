/**
 * The byte-identity law for the v1.31 outdoor tranche: **a plan that uses none of it
 * renders, describes and lints exactly as it did before it existed.**
 *
 * Every new language form ships with this law, and the form it takes here matters. A twin
 * comparison inside one run — the shape `test/site.test.ts` uses, where a plan with a `site`
 * block is compared against its site-less twin — cannot state this claim, because a `garage`
 * door is *supposed* to draw differently from a `hinged` one. The question is not "do two
 * plans agree" but "did the plans that were already here move", and only a baseline can
 * answer it. A test that compiled twice and compared would prove determinism, which is a
 * different property and one already pinned elsewhere.
 *
 * So the digests below are **hardcoded, and measured against `src/` at `5298b99`** — the
 * v1.30.0 release commit — by extracting that tree with `git archive` and running the SAME
 * {@link digestWith} against it. That helper lives in `test/byte-identity-digest.ts` rather
 * than in this file for exactly that reason: a baseline generator has to load the OLD `src/`,
 * so it cannot import a test file (which pulls in vitest and runs its own suite the moment it
 * is imported), and the alternative — a lookalike copy of the digest body in a scratch script
 * — is how an earlier attempt at this kind of test in this repository reported four
 * "failures" over artifacts that were in fact byte-identical, its payload separator differing
 * by one character.
 *
 * The payload is the whole agent-facing surface — **SVG, `describe()` and `lint()`** — not
 * just the drawing. A change that appends an empty key to every summary leaves the drawing
 * untouched and is still a behaviour change for every `arch describe --json` consumer, which
 * is the exact shape of change this tranche makes.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here
 *
 * `examples/hillside-villa.arch`. Its digests move on purpose in this tranche: its garage is
 * retagged `uses garage` and its garage door becomes the `garage` kind. Both are changes to
 * the summary and the drawing, named in `CHANGELOG.md` and measured in the commits that made
 * them. Pinning the showpiece here would either bless that silently or fail forever.
 *
 * ## When one of these moves
 *
 * That is a finding to explain before it is a diff to bless. A digest here moving means one
 * of three things: a shared code path was touched (the outdoor glyphs, the use vocabulary and
 * the door kinds are all supposed to be reachable ONLY from their own syntax), a rendering
 * change landed from elsewhere in the release (re-measure against the commit that made it,
 * and say so in the same breath), or the law is genuinely broken.

/**
 * The pins, measured at `5298b99` (v1.30.0). Each plan is here for what it would catch:
 *
 *   - `studio` — the lint-clean, import-free flagship. Furniture, doors, windows, no kinds.
 *   - `laneway-house` — every opening on a wall run and every fixture on a room or wall, so
 *     it exercises the derived-placement paths the new room-side probe sits beside.
 *   - `bungalow` — the DOOR-KIND flagship, which already uses four of the five older kinds:
 *     a sixth kind leaking into the shared door path would move this one first.
 *   - `furnished-flat` — the FURNITURE flagship, 29 of the 36 pre-v1.31 glyph families. If
 *     appending 21 families to `FIXTURE_FAMILIES` touched the dispatch, the legend order or
 *     the catalog lookups, it shows up here.
 *   - `two-bed` — a plain house with none of the above, as the control.
 *
 * ## The v1.32 re-measurement — six furniture symbols were REDRAWN
 *
 * Four of the five moved, and `studio` did NOT. v1.32's F2 track redraws eight fixture
 * symbols (`coffee_table`, `table`, `stool`, `bench`, `chair`, `tv_unit`, `nightstand`,
 * `desk`); `studio` places only bath and kitchen fixtures, so its pin is UNCHANGED — the same
 * number, not a re-blessing — and is the control saying the redraw stayed inside the glyph
 * layer. **`describe()` and `lint()` were held SHA-256 identical across the whole change**,
 * measured example by example against `8fc432a`'s `src/` (extracted with `git archive`) for
 * all 28 import-free examples: 22 SVGs moved, 0 summaries and 0 diagnostic sets.
