/**
 * L1 — the deterministic-tool tier of the eval ladder (roadmap Tranche 2; deep-dive H3).
 *
 * L0 is a raw model generation; L1 runs that source through the two *deterministic*
 * healers the language already ships — `arch fix` (syntactic span edits, ADR 0011) then
 * `arch repair` (the geometric corrector, ADR 0006) — with no model in the loop. The
 * gap ΔL0→L1 is the "free" deterministic dividend, measured here separately so it is
 * never mis-credited to a model feedback loop (H3: the free gains must be isolated from
 * any L2 loop delta).
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: the only imports are the pure core surface (`compile`,
 * `applyFixes`, `repair`). This MIRRORS the CLI's `arch fix` fixpoint (`cmdFix` in
 * src/cli.ts) — machine-applicable fixes only, a bounded number of passes, and a pass
 * that raises the compile error count is rolled back — but stays inside `eval/` rather
 * than reaching into the (unexported) CLI.
