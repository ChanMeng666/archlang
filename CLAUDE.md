# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and any AI agent) working in this repository.

The **canonical, always-current** project status, architecture, commands, and conventions live in
**[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — read it first. It is imported below so it loads with this file; for the
exact shipped state and versions, defer to AGENTS.md → "Project status" and `CHANGELOG.md` rather
than memory.

@AGENTS.md

## Orientation (the rest is in AGENTS.md)

- **What this is:** ArchLang — a small declarative language that compiles `.arch` floor-plan source
  to professional **SVG** (also DXF/PDF/PNG). Pure TypeScript, **zero runtime dependencies**,
  isomorphic (runs in Node and the browser). A published, deployed monorepo, not a WIP.
- **Build & run:** `npm run build` · `npm test` (vitest) ·
  `npm run cli -- compile examples/studio.arch -o out.svg`. A single root `npm install` bootstraps
  every workspace.

## Non-negotiable invariants (break these and CI fails)

- **`compile()` is pure, synchronous, deterministic.** No I/O, no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`
  in `src/` core; output is byte-for-byte stable and snapshot/golden-tested. Node APIs and real time
  are allowed **only** in `src/cli.ts`; everything else gets its environment via the `World` seam.
  Route number formatting through `fmt()` so floats don't drift.
- **Don't hand-edit generated files.** `dist/`, `editors/*.tmLanguage.json`,
  `playground/src/arch-language.js`, `docs/error-codes.md`, `spec.llm.md`, and `llms-full.txt` are
  generated — edit the source (`src/grammar/tokens.ts`, `src/error-catalog.ts`, `examples/`,
  `SKILL.md`) and run the matching `npm run gen:grammars` / `gen:errors` / `gen:spec` / `gen:llms`.
  CI fails on drift.
- **Errors are returned, never thrown** for user-source problems: push a `Diagnostic` with a byte
  `span` and a catalogued `E_*`/`W_*` code (`src/error-catalog.ts` — a test enforces every raised
  code has an entry and vice-versa).
- **Adding an element = one module** in `src/elements/` exporting an `ElementDef`, registered in
  `src/elements/defs.ts`. Dispatch goes through the registry, not a switch.

## Verify your work the way the tool is used

After a change, prove it through the CLI, not by eyeballing SVG:
`arch compile --json` (renders, errors-as-data) · `arch describe --json` (rooms, areas, adjacency,
door connections) · `arch lint --json` (architectural soundness). Keep the flagship
`examples/studio.arch` **lint-clean and import-free**, and update snapshots/goldens
(`vitest -u`, `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 vitest run test/visual.test.ts`) only after reviewing the diff.

## Conventions

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Run the lint/test commands
before proposing changes. Commit or push only when asked. Keep AGENTS.md and this file accurate when
you change build steps, structure, or conventions.
